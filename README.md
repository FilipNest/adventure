Adventure
=========

An overlay of adventures onto the real world

The plan
--------

A map of the world which people can add quests to. Quests are made up of points which include adventure game dialogue like choices (some of which are actual dialogue).

Users travel the world completing quests by taking these choices (in the real world thanks to geolocation) and collecting points towards a variable set of character attributes.
